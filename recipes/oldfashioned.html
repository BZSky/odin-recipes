    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Other mixed drinks pre-date the Old Fashioned but "The Old-Fashioned
      Whiskey Cocktail", to give it its' full name, is considered the original
      "cocktail" with its component parts: spirit, sugar, water and bitters the
      very definition of what a true cocktail is.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a history of a name, of course. At first, the recipe was simple:
      spirit, sugar, water and bitters, stirred together.<br />Then it evolved:
      <br />
      Some added cherries, some â€“ muddled fruits, others added both!
      <br />
      Thankfully, in much of Europe and the UK, the fruited Old Fashioned never
      took off and the few drinkers that continued to order Old Fashioneds
      tended to prefer the classic whiskey, sugar and bitters serve. They asked
      to make the drink in "old-fashioned way", hence the name.
