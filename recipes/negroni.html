    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ah, Negroni! The italian classic cocktail that never tastes the same,
      despite having an easy recipe. Glowing red, the Negroni manages to be both
      sophisticated and simple at the same time and is definitely for a grown-up
      palate - for many it's simply too bitter. It takes its depth from the
      vermouth, is centred by the bittersweet liqueur, and is made to sing
      through the vitality of the gin. It makes the perfect aperitivo and,
      though popular the world over, is the traditional default during aperitivo
      hour in Milan. <br />
      Hence, the gin and vermouth you use can transform the taste of your
      Negroni significantly.
